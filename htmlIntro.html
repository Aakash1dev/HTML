        HTML 
        
        * HTML stands for "Hyper Text Markup Language". The meaning of "Hyper Text" is "Text within Text".
        * It is a way to link two or more webpages. In simpler words,
        * if you have links which display & brings you to a new webpage, you have clicked on Hypertext. 
        * "Markup language" is computer language that consist of easily understand keywords, 
        *  tags that help format the overall view of pages and the data it contains.
        
        * A system of tags used to define the structure & formatting of a document. 
        * HTML uses tags to specify elements like headings, paragraphs, images, links and more. 
        * These tags tell the web browser how to display the content. 
        * HTML is a building block of web pages, is the standard markup language for creating webpages. 
        * HTML is not case sensitive. 
        
        # Tags 
        
        * Tags are the building block of HTML. They are enclosed "< >". 
        * They define the structure & meaning of content. 
        * Ex: <html>, <head>, <body>, <h1>, <b>, <a>, <title>, <img>, etc. 
            
        # Elements 
        
        * An element is formed by a starting tag, content & an ending tag. 
        * Ex: <p> The Russian's made Su-75 checkmate is the most advanced jet.</p> 
        * <p> tag defines a paragraph, and the text between the opening and closing tags is the content.
        * The whole data include <p>content</p> is the element.


        # Attributes

        * Attributes provide additional information about an element.
        * They are placed within the opening tag & consist of a name and a value, separated by an equal sign.
        * Ex: <a href="https://www.example.com" target="_blank"> Visit Example Website </a>
        * In the above example, in the <a> tag, href is an attribute that specifies the link's destination.
        * terget="_blank" is another attribute that opens the link in a new window or tab.
        * In HTML, attributes are additional pieces of information that you can provide to an HTML element
        * to modify its behavior, appearance, or provide extra context.   
        
        Here's a breakdown:
        Purpose:
        
        Control appearance: Change font size, color, add styles.
        Define behavior: Set links, specify input types, control media playback.   
        Provide metadata: Add extra information like image source, alt text, language.
        Syntax:
        
        Attributes are written within the opening tag of an element.   
        They consist of a name and a value, separated by an equals sign (=).   
        The value is usually enclosed in double quotes (").   
        
        Example:
        
        <img src="image.jpg" alt="A beautiful landscape"> 
        Explanation:
        <img> is the HTML element for an image.
        src="image.jpg" is an attribute that specifies the source of the image.
        alt="A beautiful landscape" is an attribute that provides alternative text for screen readers
        and when the image fails to load.
        
        Common HTML Attributes:
        
        src: Specifies the source of an image, audio, or video file.   
        href: Specifies the URL of a hyperlink.   
        alt: Provides alternative text for images.   
        style: Defines CSS styles for an element.   
        class: Assigns a CSS class to an element.   
        id: Assigns a unique ID to an element.   
        type: Specifies the type of input element (e.g., text, number, email).   
        value: Specifies the default value for an input element.   
        
        Key Points:
        
        Not all elements have the same attributes.
        Some attributes are required for certain elements to function properly.   
        Attributes can significantly impact the presentation and functionality of your web pages.
        
        # Entities
        
        In HTML, entities are special codes that represent characters that are difficult or impossible
        to type directly into HTML code. These characters include:
        
        * Reserved characters:** Characters that have a special meaning in HTML, 
          such as `<` (less than), `>` (greater than), and `&` (ampersand).
        * Special characters:** Characters that are not available on a standard keyboard, 
          such as copyright ©, trademark ™, and euro €.
        * Invisible characters:** Characters that are not visible when rendered in a document, 
          such as non-breaking spaces.
        
        How to Use HTML Entities
        
        HTML entities are represented by either their name or their number:
        
        Entity names:
        * Start with an ampersand (`&`)
        * Followed by the entity name
        * End with a semicolon (`;`)
        * Example: `&lt;` for less than (`<`), `&gt;` for greater than (`>`)
        
        Entity numbers:
        * Start with an ampersand (`&`)
        * Followed by a number sign (`#`)
        * Followed by the entity number
        * End with a semicolon (`;`)
        * Example: `&#60;` for less than (`<`), `&#62;` for greater than (`>`)
        
        Examples
        
        Displaying the less than sign (`<`):
        * `&lt;` or `&#60;`
        
        Displaying the greater than sign (`>`):
        * `&gt;` or `&#62;`
        
        Displaying the ampersand (`&`):
        * `&amp;`
        
        Displaying the copyright symbol (`©`):
        * `&copy;` or `&#169;`
        
        Displaying the euro symbol (`€`):
        * `&euro;` or `&#8364;`
        
        Why Use HTML Entities?
        
        * Prevent browser misinterpretation: Reserved characters like `<` and `>` are used to define HTML tags. 
          If you use them directly in your content, the browser might interpret them as part of a tag, 
          leading to unexpected results.
        * Display special characters: Many special characters are not available on standard keyboards. 
          HTML entities provide a way to display these characters correctly.
        * Improve accessibility: Using HTML entities can improve the accessibility of your web pages
          by making them more understandable for screen readers and other assistive technologies.
        
        By using HTML entities, you can ensure that your web pages are displayed correctly and accurately in all browsers.
        
        
        # The simple HTML document looks like given below -
        
        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html lang="en">
            <head>
                <meta charset="UTF-8">
                <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
                <title>Document</title>
            </head>
            <body>
                
            </body>
            </html>
            
        * <!DOCTYPE html> 
        This "<!DOCTYPE html>" is called the Document Type Declaration. It lets the browser know what type of HTML you are using.
        As written above, this tells the browser we are using the most recent version of HTML which is HTML 5. 

        * <html> 
        this tag is container for all other HTML tags except <!DOCTYPE html>.
        Hence anything that falls between <html> and </html> is interpreted by the browser as being html. 
        
        * <head> 
        Tag to define the head portion of the document, which does not appear in the main browser window
        but mainly contains information about the HTML document, called "metadata". 
        "Metadata" is describe the data about data, that what types of data is.
        It can also contains imports from external stylesheets & scripts (CSS, JS). 
            
        * <meta> 
        Gives the browser some metadata about the document. The charset attribute declares the character encoding. 
        Modern HTML document should always use UTF-8. 
            
        → <title> 
        The title of the page. Text written between this opening and 
        the closing tag (</title>) will be displayed on the tab of the page or in the title bar of the browser. 
        
        → <body> 
        contains all content of HTML document that is shown to 
        the user i.e. all the visible and audible content of a page. 
        No content should be added after the closing tag </body>.
        
            </textarea
      >
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
